  <interface name="wp_security_context_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="client security context manager">
      This interface allows a client to register a new Wayland connection to
      the compositor and attach a security context to it.

      This is intended to be used by sandboxes. Sandbox engines attach a
      security context to all connections coming from inside the sandbox. The
      compositor can then restrict the features that the sandboxed connections
      can use.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        Creates a new security context with a socket listening FD.

        The compositor will accept new client connections on listen_fd.
        listen_fd must be ready to accept new connections when this request is
        sent by the client. In other words, the client must call bind(2) and
        listen(2) before sending the FD.

        close_fd is a FD closed by the client when the compositor should stop
        accepting new connections on listen_fd.

        The compositor must continue to accept connections on listen_fd when
        the Wayland client which created the security context disconnects.
